# Get Started

Welcome to the Data Provider section of your collaboration space.  
As a Data Provider, you are responsible for delivering high-quality, secure data to the collaboration solution.  
For each data source you provide, you must configure a separate collaborator.  
Datavillage standard use encrypted data file and Google Cloud Bucket.  
Datavillage support other file formats and storages, for more information, contact the support team.

## Key Responsibilities

- **Data Provisioning:** Supply data to the collaboration solution.
- **Collaborator Setup:** Configure a distinct collaborator for every data source.
- **Data Security:** Encrypt your data to safeguard sensitive information.
- **Storage:** Upload your encrypted data to a secure storage.

## Workflow

Follow these steps to get started as a Data Provider:

1. **Accept Your Invitation**  
   If you haven't done so already, accept your invitation to join the collaboration space.  
   You will receive one invitation per data source.  
   [Accept Invitation](/docs/user-manual/data-provider/accept-invitation)

2. **Encrypt Your Data**  
   You can also provide unencrypted data in JSON or CSV format, but Datavillage does not recommend this for security reasons.    
   Ensure that all data is encrypted.  
   [Generate encryption key](/docs/user-manual/data-provider/encryption/create-encryption-key)

3. **Set up your storage**  
   Upload your data to your secure storage and get credentials.  
   - **With Google Cloud Storage**  
      Securely upload your encrypted data to a designated Google Cloud bucket.  
      [Create Bucket](/docs/user-manual/data-provider/google-cloud-storage/create-bucket)  
      [Create Service Account](/docs/user-manual/data-provider/google-cloud-storage/create-service-account)
