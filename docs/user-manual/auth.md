# Register your organization

Welcome to the **Register your organization** section of our documentation.  
The creation of clients and accounts must be requested through the Datavillage support team.

Within the Data Collaboration Platform, every registered organization is called a **client**.  
These organizations often consist of several people, each having their own role within the organization.  
Each client will have a dedicated url to connect to the platform.

## Client and account creation

All client and account creations must be requested through the Datavillage support team.  
This process guarantees that every new client and account is set up correctly with the proper permissions and security measures.  
The support contact is: support@datavillage.ai.

## Bring Your Own Identity Provider

If you wish to integrate your own Identity Provider into your collaboration space, you can do so.  
For more information, please [contact us](mailto:support@datavillage.ai).
