# Configure Environment Variables

Within your collaborator configuration, you can add environment variables using a simple `name:value` format. This allows you to define the necessary parameters required by your algorithm.

For example, to set environment variables, simply add them as:


**Notes:**
- Use the `NAME:VALUE` format for each variable.
- Enclose values in quotes if they include spaces or special characters.
- Only add the variables you need to keep the configuration clear.

Properly configuring these environment variables ensures your algorithm runs with the correct settings within the collaboration space.
