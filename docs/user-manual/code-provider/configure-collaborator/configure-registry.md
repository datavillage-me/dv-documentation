# Configure Registry

To ensure seamless deployment of your Docker image, you must configure your Code Provider collaborator with the following details:

- **Registry Address:**  
  The URL of your Docker registry.

- **Image Tag:**  
  The specific tag for your Docker image.

- **Private Key/Access Token:**  
  A secure token used for authenticating image pulls from your registry.

By correctly configuring these settings, your collaboration space will be able to securely fetch and deploy your Docker image.
