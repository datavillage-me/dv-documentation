# Welcome

Welcome to the Data Provider section of your collaboration space. As a Data Provider, you are responsible for delivering high-quality, secure data to the collaboration solution. For each data source you provide, you must configure a separate collaborator. Additionally, all data must be encrypted in a parquet file and stored securely in a Google Cloud bucket.
Datavillage is able to work other file format and storage, for more information, contact the support.

## Key Responsibilities

- **Data Provisioning:** Supply data to the collaboration solution.
- **Collaborator Setup:** Configure a distinct collaborator for every data source.
- **Data Security:** Encrypt your data to safeguard sensitive information.
- **Cloud Storage:** Upload your encrypted data to a Google Cloud bucket.

## Workflow

Follow these steps to get started as a Data Provider:

1. **Accept Your Invitation**  
   If you haven't done so already, accept your invitation to join the collaboration space.  
   You will receive one invitation per data source.
