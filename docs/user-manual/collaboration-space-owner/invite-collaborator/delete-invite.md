# Delete invite

If an invitation is no longer needed or was created in error, you can delete it from your collaboration space. Please note that deleting an invitation is irreversible.

## Important considerations

- **Irreversible action:**  
  Deleting an invitation permanently removes it from the system and cannot be undone.
- **Impact on collaboration:**  
  Ensure that the intended organization is informed before deletion if the invitation has already been shared.

## How to delete an invitation

1. **Access the invitation list:**  
   Navigate to the main dashboard.

2. **Locate the invitation:**  
   Find the invitation you wish to delete by its Invitation ID or by reviewing the collaborator type.

3. **Delete the invitation:**  
   Click the **Cancel** button next to the invitation. A confirmation dialog will appear.

4. **Confirm deletion:**  
   Confirm by clicking the **Confirm** button in the dialog. The invitation will then be permanently removed.
