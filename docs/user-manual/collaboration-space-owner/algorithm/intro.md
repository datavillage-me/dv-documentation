# Getting started

Welcome to the **Algorithm** section of your collaboration space.  
As a Collaboration Space Owner, you are responsible for developing and maintaining the Algorithm.  
If another organization is responsible for the Algorithm, it will be called a code provider, you just have to send a collaborator invitation to this organization.

## Your workflow

Follow these steps to get create your algorithm:

1. **Create the collaborator**

   - As the **collaboration space owner**, follow the **create invite flow**, instead of copying the ID, click on **Join As**  
     [Create algorithm](/docs/user-manual/collaboration-space-owner/invite-collaborator/create-invite)

   - If you are not the **collaboration space owner**, create the invite, and share the ID  
     [Accept invite](/docs/user-manual/data-collaborator/accept-invite)

2. **Configure the algorithm provider**

   - Configure your Algorithm provider with default values to deploy it.  
     [Configure algorithm](/docs/user-manual/collaboration-space-owner/algorithm/configure)

3. **Deploy the collaboration space**

   - Before to do anything else, deploy your space.
