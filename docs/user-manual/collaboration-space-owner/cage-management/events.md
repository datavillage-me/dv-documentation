# Events

You can send events to your collaboration space.  
Those events will be received by the algorithm to trigger actions.  
Events are accessible in the **Execution** page of your collaboration space.

## Event structure

- **Type**: The event label, used in the algorithm to identify the action requested.
- **Payload**: The event data in JSON format.
