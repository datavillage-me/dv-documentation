# Authentication & Authorization

Welcome to the Authentication & Authorization section of our documentation. This page outlines the roles and permissions required for each collaborator in your collaboration space. Please note that the creation of clients and accounts must be requested through the Datavillage support team.

Within the Data Collaboration Platform, every registered organization is called a client. These organizations often consist of several people, each having their own role within the organization. The roles that are given to the different users should follow the convention as defined in the authorization section.

## Client and account creation

All client and account creations must be requested through the Datavillage support team. This process guarantees that every new client and account is set up correctly with the proper permissions and security measures. [contact us](mailto:support@datavillage.ai)

## Example

For our real-word use case you must require the creation of the following clients and accounts:

**Client: Financial Institution** - Account roles: - collaboration-space:admin - data-contract:writer - collaborator:writer - collaboration-space:operator

**Client: Bank A** - Account roles: - collaboration-space:reader - collaborator:writer - data-contract:reader

**Client: Bank B** - Account roles: - collaboration-space:reader - collaborator:writer - data-contract:reader

The support will send to the users their url and credentials.

## Bring Your Own Identity Provider

If you wish to integrate your own Identity Provider into your collaboration space, you can do so. For more information, please [contact us](mailto:support@datavillage.ai).
