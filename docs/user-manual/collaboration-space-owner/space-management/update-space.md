- **Category:** The business category associated with the space.
- **Description:** A brief overview of the space's purpose.

> **Tip:** When updating, ensure consistency with your organization’s naming conventions and overall collaboration strategy.

1. **Open Space Settings:**  
   From your space dashboard, access the settings or management panel.

2. **Edit Space Properties:**  
   Modify the space properties—such as name, category, and description—as needed.

3. **Save Changes:**
