# Delete space

When you no longer need a collaboration space, you have the option to delete it. Deleting a space permanently removes all its associated data and configurations. Please proceed with caution, as this action is irreversible.

## Important considerations

Before deleting a space, ensure that:

- You have backed up any critical data or configurations.
- All collaborators have been informed about the deletion.
- The space is no longer in active use.

1. **Open space settings:**  
   Navigate to the space dashboard and access the settings or management panel.

2. **Initiate deletion:**  
   Locate and click the **Delete Space** option.

3. **Confirm deletion:**  
   A confirmation dialog will appear. Read the warnings carefully and confirm the deletion by clicking the **Confirm** button.
