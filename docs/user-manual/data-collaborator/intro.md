# Getting started

Welcome to the **data collaborator** section of your collaboration space.  
There are two different data collaborators:

- **Data provider**
  - Provides data to the space
- **Data consumer**
  - Gets the data generated by the algorithm

The platform supports reading and writing from **S3 bucket** data source.  
Supporting these files format:

- **JSON**
- **CSV**
- **Parquet**
- Encrypted **Parquet**

We are able to implement other data source, if you need one, [contact us](mailto:support@datavillage.ai).

## Key responsibilities

- Configure a distinct collaborator for every data source.
- Provide a data source for the algorithm to read or write data.

Data can optionally be encrypted to enhance security of sensitive information.

## Workflow

Follow these steps to get started as a data collaborator:

1. **Accept your invitation**

   - If you haven't done so already, accept your invitation to join the collaboration space.
   - You will receive one invitation per data source.
   - This is further explained in the [Join space](/docs/user-manual/data-collaborator/accept-invite) section.

2. **Set up your storage**

   - Upload your data to your secure storage and get the credentials to access them.

   - **With Google cloud storage (GCS)**  
      Securely upload your encrypted data to a designated GCS bucket.  
      [Create bucket](/docs/user-manual/data-collaborator/google-cloud-storage/create-bucket)  
      [Create service account](/docs/user-manual/data-collaborator/google-cloud-storage/create-service-account)

3. **Configure your collaborator**

   - For every unique data source, configure the collaborator.
   - This is further explained in the [Configure collaborator](/docs/user-manual/data-collaborator/configure) section.

4. **Add your storage credentials**
   - For every collaborator, add the credentials for access.
   - This is further explained in the [Configure data source secrets](/docs/user-manual/data-collaborator/configure-secrets) section.

By following these steps, you will ensure that your data is securely managed and properly integrated into the collaboration space. For further assistance, please consult the relevant sections of our documentation or contact support.
