# Introduction

Welcome to the **Develop Algorithm** section of our documentation. Here you’ll find everything you need to get started with **dv_utils** and to build, test, and refine your custom algorithms.

## Overview

- **dv_utils** is our python library to communicate with Datavillage modules.
- We provide a [**template**](reference-repositories/cage-template) and a [**demo**](reference-repositories/algorithm-demo) to kick-start your development.
- The **learn by example**section offers practical walkthroughs to guide you step by step.
- Full API details are available in the dedicated **dv_utils** documentation.
- Our support team is here to help you.

## Learn by example

Follow this real-world use case to detect and investigate suspected accounts:

1. [List collaborators](learn-by-example/list-collaborators)  
   Retrieve and sort the list of collaborators of your secured collaboration space.

2. [Check collaborator status](learn-by-example/check-status)  
   Check collaborator status to know if it mounted or other status.

3. [Mount collaborator](learn-by-example/mount)  
   Mount your collaborator to be able to read or write data.

4. [Query](learn-by-example/query)  
   Execute query on your mounted data providers to retrieve data.

5. [Export](learn-by-example/export)  
   Export your processed data to your consumer.
