https://github.com/datavillage-me/algorithm-demo # Algorithm Demo

This repository is a demo from which one can start to develop an algorithm to be run in a cage in the Datavillage DCP.
To implement your own algorithm, clone this repo and edit `process.py`.

| File name                           | Usage                                                                                                                                                           |

| requirements.txt                    | The python dependencies needed to run the code.                                                                                                                 |
| process.py                          | The implementation of the algorithm. It contains a method `event_processor(evt: dict)` where processing begins.                                                 |
| index.py                            | Entry point of the code when it's ran in a cage. It starts an event listener that registers the incoming events and passes them to the `event_processor` method |

## Events

Following events are supported

```json
{
  "type": "EX_GET_FRAUDULENT_ACCOUNTS"
}
```

- Mount the two providers "BANKALIST" & "BANKBLIST"
- Mount the consumer "BANKBAGG"
- Get accounts when bank_id = "QPSBDEB1"
- Aggregate on account_number
- Write the result to "BANKBAGG"

## Run in cage

When the algorithm is deployed, the listener created in `index.py` will start and listen to the Redis queue for events.
When an event is received, it is first registered in the logging module. This makes sure the event is printed with every log statement from the execution of that event.
After that, the event is passed to the `event_processor` method that is passed in the constructor.
