# Datavillage Documentation

Created with [docusaurus-openapi-docs](https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/docusaurus-openapi-docs) plugin for [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/).

## Start development server

To start the project, do the expected steps:

```bash
yarn
```

```bash
yarn build
```

```bash
yarn start
```

A development server will start on `http://localhost:3000`.

## File structure docs folder

When running `yarn build`, Docusaurus will parse the files in the `docs/` folder to static HTML pages that are saved in the `build` folder.

The `api` folder contains files generated by the [docusaurus-openapi-docs](https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/docusaurus-openapi-docs). **You should never manually edit these!**

The other subdirectories of `docs` contain manually created Markdown files.

## Generate from OpenAPI specs

This sections shows how to apply changes to the OpenAPI files in the `api/` folder and regenerate the corresponding files in the `docs/api` folder.

### File structure

The configuration is loaded from the file structure in the `api/` folder. This looks as follows

```text
|-- api/
|---- <project1_id>/
|------ <version1>.yaml
|------ <version2>.yaml
|------ ...
|---- <project2_id>/
|------ <version1>.yaml
|------ <version2>.yaml
|------ ...
|---- ...
```

### Update latest version

Apply the needed changes to the corresponding yaml files in the `api/` folder. Then, run

```bash
yarn docusaurus clean-api-docs all
```

to clean the previously generated files, and

```bash
yarn docusaurus gen-api-docs all
```

to regenerate them. If the development server was already running, it should rebuild the static HTML files automatically.

In the `docusaurus.config.ts` file, you can find the ids of the different projects. To regenerate the files for a specific project, replace `all` with the id in the previous commands

> _Note:_ This will only generate the latest version. To regenerate all versions, continu reading

### Add new API version

Add the specs of the new version with the correct name in the correct folder.
Use the commands of the previous section to update the docs for the most recent version.

What is left to do, is to generate the new legacy version (the previous latest version). To do this, run following command

```bash
yarn docusaurus gen-api-docs:version <project_id>:<version>
```

To regenerate all versions of a project (also an option, but takes longer):

```bash
yarn docusaurus gen-api-docs:version <project_id>:all
```

## Global versions

In the future, we will want a way to version the platform, which will be a collection of versions of components that are well integrated. We can achieve this with [docusaurus versioning](https://docusaurus.io/docs/versioning) (you can already see it in action in the Docusaurus documentation itself)

We should be carefull with this as it significantly increases the size of the repository and makes it harder to manage. Also, we need to consider the fact that if someone wants to find the documentation of an older version of a certain component, that person needs to know to which global version this belongs.
